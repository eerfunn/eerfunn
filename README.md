# About me
- I like anime ðŸ’–, mainly Slice of Life and Isekai genre
- Since 2022 I'd prefer using node js, and I surprised PHP & Laravel Blade is my top stat :3
- Studying Information Systems at UPNVJ since 2019
- Looking for working with learning opportunities,  I always feel that I still need to learn before I can applying for fulltime software engineer jobs
- I'll be honest and said "I'm very reward oriented person, as long as the reward good enough for me, I'll do almost everything to accomplish the tasks"
- I learn English mainly from interact with others everyday in social media and game, sorry if I did not use the right grammar
