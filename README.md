**_"Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life, ...and the only way to do great work is to love what you do._**\
**_And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know, what you truly want to become_**\
**_Everything else, is secondary." — Steve Jobs_**

### About Me

- 💖 Anime stuffs, oftentimes going to anime convention (When I have money, and that's why I'm looking for a job rn xD)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Digital Art (Still learning anatomy and perspective .\_.)
- 🔭 I played a lot of games (Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves, Arena Breakout, and other mobile games [my laptop sucks])
- Looking for a job (However if I can I want to work on anime-related company, because it's better to work on something that you like, right?)

#### My favorite speech by Steve Jobs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc

### **_Sometimes I wish to go back to the past and focused on art lesson to be an anime illustrator, instead of playing with IT shit(s) and running from bullies..._**

> If you read this, I wish you can follow your passion. To be be able to follow your own passion, to be yourself, don't think too much about people opinion, and to be proud of your works and your self is just wonderful way of living. - From someone who's regret his life, because he always bow down to "others".

### Thanks for your visit, wish you always happy, and have a great day!🌟
